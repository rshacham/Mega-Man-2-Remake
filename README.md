  # About
  
  The project was made as part of the "Game Dev Foundations" Course of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem &  Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.
    
  The assignment was to remake one game from the 80s' using Unity, and i chose the NES game Mega-Man 2 which i was a fond of as a child.
    
  This remake consists of 2 levels - a remake to the level "Wood Man" from the original game, followed by a self-designed level.
